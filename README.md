# Cycling BLE Sensor Tester

This is a really simple macOS app develop using SwiftUI.

All it does is scan Bluetooth sensors for HR service and Cycling Power Service, allow the user to connect whichever sensor they want and then plot HR and power in a couple of charts.

I used it to try to compare different HR monitors such Garmin Dual HR and Wahoo TICKR X.

I have 2 Garmin HRM Dual and 2 Wahoo TICKR X and I know that the Wahoos had some issues so I wanted to take a closer look. It seems like both Garmin are spot on and I get the same data from each sensor whereas Wahoo is all over the place and both sensor seem bad.
